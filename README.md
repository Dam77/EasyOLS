Econometrics Project
Hi there! I’m Damien Lebas, an economics student with a deep love for statistics and data science.

I always try to push my skills further, and one way I do that is by using Python to solve almost all my exercises, even when it’s not required. This project is part of my portfolio because, honestly, I think it’s one of the coolest things I’ve done so far!

As someone who dreams of becoming a data analyst or data scientist, this project is my way of showing that I have solid econometric and statistical skills. Let me walk you through it.


Why This Project?
This repository is more than just code; it’s a reflection of my learning journey. I’ve divided it into two parts:

1. Base Folder
This is where it all started. In this folder, I wanted to get hands-on with the mathematical foundations of econometrics. Here’s what you’ll find:

Manual calculations for estimating coefficients, total standard deviation, and standard deviation of the coefficients.
An interactive console-based approach that lets you input data manually and follow the step-by-step calculations.
Why did I do this?
Because I believe the best way to truly understand econometrics is to build it from scratch. By working directly with matrices and calculations, I deepened my understanding of the core concepts.

Who is this for?

Students curious about econometrics and how things work under the hood.
Professionals or anyone who wants to see how I approach statistical problems.
How to use it?

Run main.py.
Follow the instructions in the console. It’s as simple as that!
2. App Folder
This is the polished version of the project, designed for people who just want to get things done quickly. Here’s what’s different:

A Streamlit-based interface that’s clean, interactive, and user-friendly.
The ability to upload datasets and get results (like coefficient estimations) in just a few clicks.
Who is this for?

People who need results quickly and don’t want to dive into the calculations.
Anyone who appreciates a smooth, no-hassle experience.
How to use it?

Open the App folder.
Launch the Streamlit app, upload your dataset, and let it do the work for you.
Some Notes About OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)
If you’ve studied econometrics, you probably know that the OLS method comes with a few assumptions. Let me quickly remind you:

Linearity: The relationship between variables is linear.
Independent errors: The residuals (errors) aren’t correlated with each other.
Homoscedasticity: The residuals have constant variance.
Normality: The residuals follow a normal distribution (mean: 0, var: always the same).
No multicollinearity: The independent variables aren’t perfectly correlated.
No endogeneity: The independent variables aren’t correlated with the residuals.
Now, here’s the thing:
In this project, we’re assuming these assumptions are valid. We won’t test them explicitly, but if this is something you’re curious about, it’s definitely something I can explore in the future.

Why I Built This Project
This project is more than just an exercise for me. It’s my way of saying:
"I understand econometrics, and I can use it to solve real-world problems."

The Base folder shows that I can handle the theoretical side.
The App folder shows that I can create tools that make econometrics accessible to others.


If you’re a student, researcher, or recruiter, I hope this project gives you a good idea of my passion and abilities. Feedback is always welcome!

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
